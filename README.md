## About The Project
End of December 2019, COVID 19 new virus was found in Wuhan, Hubei, China. The virus has spread globally since its discovery. Like other countries, we are facing many challenges with COVID 19. The number of COVID 19 victims is increasing day by day. Therefore, the public gathering is not so good. In Sri Lanka, most systems are running manually.   


Phoenix Airline PVT is an airline with a small online flight booking system. Other processes, such as user management, flight management, and ticket management, are done manually. Currently, they cannot do them manually. So, they required a website for that. There are three types of users: Staff, Users (client), and Admin. Users and Staff can create their accounts by themself.
